You feel like your company should be launching AI-solutions that help generate new revenues. But how can you do this?</p>\n<p>First of all let's dig a bit deeper on what is AI, i.e. artificial intelligence, or also referred to as ML, i.e. machine learning, and how can it help companies? AI normally is a model that first gets trained on lots of data and afterwards can be used to answer questions, make predictions, translate, generate images, drive a car, make investments, diagnose a problem,... The first step is to train the model and for that you need to have lots of data. Often pre-trained models are used so company and industry specific data is now only used for fine-tuning the model. More and more AI models are also integrated with external services, e.g. ChatGPT does not know the weather were you are, but it can ask a weather service to tell it.</p>\n<h2>Getting to 100% accurate AI models</h2>\n<p>Often business people are asking for 100% accurate AI models to resolve a problem humans cannot, e.g. train a model that can read any doctor's handwriting so we can process their reports a lot faster. Trying to substitute a human by bringing in an AI-model is likely going to fail. The 100% accurate AI model does not exist. To solve any AI challenge, you need to assume AI can make mistakes, just like humans, so we need to rethink how we apply this new technology so it works around its own limitations.</p>\n<p>To generate revenues with AI, you need to be solving either a broad problem everybody has or be able to quickly fine-tune AI for many personalised problems. You might be lucky and have that broad problem but chances are high you are not. Even if you need to fine-tune AI models for individual customers, that is still possible and can be done at scale.</p>\n<p>We are happy to explore how we can help with free consulting around your AI Hairy Potter Problem, just <a href=\"https://forms.gle/AVe73hV4o35AnsFr5\">fill out the form</a>.</p>\n","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/blog/hello-world/cover.jpg"},"coverImage":"/assets/blog/hello-world/cover.jpg"}},"__N_SSG":true}
